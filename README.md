This repository demonstrates a common Objective-C bug involving Key-Value Observing (KVO).  The `KVODeallocBug.m` file shows the problematic code where an observer is not removed in the `dealloc` method, leading to a crash when the observed object is deallocated.  The solution, provided in `KVODeallocBugSolution.m`, shows how to correctly remove the observer to prevent the crash.  This is crucial for avoiding EXC_BAD_ACCESS errors and ensuring application stability.
